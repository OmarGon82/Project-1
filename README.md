# Project-1
This is my first project for the Team Treehouse tech degree. This project is a random quote generator. In this project, I created an array of objects to hold quotes and related information for those quotes. The quotes are then randomly changed with a random color background. The quotes can also be changed if the 'show another quote' button is clicked. 

For this project, I chose The Simpsons quotes as I am a big fan of the show and a big fan of comedy as well. I hope the quotes bring back good memories of great Simpsons episodes.
